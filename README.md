# Comparing Teenage Birth Rates of Females with Low-Income Parents in Baltimore, MD to Miami, FL
## Background
  The article [Socioeconomic Disadvantage as a Social Determinant of Teen Childbearing in the U.S.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3562742/) finds that "unfavorable socioeconomic conditions" are a contributing factor to high teen birth rates in the United States. Teenage births are associated with adverse outcomes for both the child and the mother.  
  
  This topic is interesting because although teenage birth rates in the US have gone down, the _absolute_ teenage birth rate is high. In 2010, the teenage birth rate was a low 34.3 births per 1,000 people. However, absolute teenage births were still high at 370,000 total teenage births in the same year. Further research is necessary to tackle the factors that impact teenage birth rates and to identify any possible interventions. 
  
  This project explores open data from the Opportunity Atlas Group on teenage birth rates of females from low-income families in Baltimore, MD and Miami, FL. The data takes teenage birth rates from tracts within neighborhoods in each city. Several tracts can make up a neighborhood.
  
  ## Business Question

## Data Sources
1. Opportunity Atlas
  - [Miami](https://github.com/vickidecastro/comparing-baltimore-miami-teenage-birthrate-lowincome-parents/blob/master/shown_tract_teenbirth_rP_gF_p25%20miami.csv): Original open data on teenage birth rates of females from low-income families in Miami, FL
  - [Baltimore](https://github.com/vickidecastro/comparing-baltimore-miami-teenage-birthrate-lowincome-parents/blob/master/shown_tract_teenbirth_rP_gF_p25%20baltimore.csv): Original open data on teenage birth rates of females from low-income families in Baltimore, MD
  - Teenage birth rate is defined as the fraction of women who claimed to have ever had a child when she was between the ages of 13 - 19, who also claimed dependent status. It is important to note that these estimates have a margin of error and that any time "Teen" or "Teenage birth rate" are mentioned in this project, this refers to the birth rate of teenage girls coming from low-income families.
